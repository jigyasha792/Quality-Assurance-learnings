Day-1 AUTOMATION TESTING
Automation testing makes the testing process more easier. It is 70% more faster than manual testing.
The scripts of automation testing can be reused.
Types of Automation Testing:
1. Regression testing
The process of testing the software after new features are added is called regression testing.
it is performed when: environment is changed, code is changed: new features added, requirements changed, some issues/bug/defect fixed.
2. Smoke testing
